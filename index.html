								<h3>OVERVIEW</h3>
								<p>The goal of this project is to build an end-to-end batch data pipeline on Esports Earnings Data available at <a href="https://www.esportsearnings.com/" target="_blank">Esports Earnings</a>. In addition, perform ELT (Extract Load Transform) monthly in order to analyze the esports earnings patterns from historical data to till date..</p>
								<h3>Problem Statement</h3>
								<h4>Data</h4>
								<p>The Data selected for this project is the Esports Earnings obtained from <a href="https://www.esportsearnings.com/" target="_blank">Esports Earnings</a>. This data includes esports earnings filed with the Esports Earnings community-driven competitive gaming resource based on freely available public information. The accuracy of this website is dependent on user contributions. Data since 1998. The Data is extracted via Esports Earnings API.</p>
								<h4>Proposed Solution</h4>
								<p>This project aims at extracting this data from the source via API and building a BATCH ELT which will be scheduled to run monthly and update the connected Dashboard for monthly Analytics & Reporting.</p>
								<h3>Data Pipeline Overview</h3>

								<h3>ETL Steps</h3>
								<p>Steps in the ELT are as follows:</p>
								<ol>
									<li>A Project is created on <b>GCP</b> </li>
									<li>Esports Earnings API key is obtained by creating an account on <a href="https://www.esportsearnings.com/dev" target="_blank">Esports Earnings</a>, which will be used to extract the data from the source.</li>
									<li>Infrastructure for the Project is created using <b>Terraform</b> which creates the following:</li>
									<ul>
										<li><b>Datalake:</b> Google Cloud Storage Bucket where the raw and cleaned data will be stored</li>
										<li><b>Data Warehouse:</b> Three Datasets on BigQuery namely "esports_bronze", "esports_silver" and "esports_gold" are created in order to store the tables/views during different stages of ELT</li>
										<li><b>Artifact Registry:</b> A place to manage the container (Docker) images</li>
									</ul>
									<li>Prefect Cloud API is obtained by creating an account on Prefect Cloud</li>
									<li>The Pipeline for ELT is created on the Docker Image and is scheduled for monthly execution. It is orchestrated via ***Prefect Cloud***; which does the following tasks</li>
									<ul>
										<li>Extracts raw data from source via Esports Earnings Data API</li>
										<li>Loads raw data as parquet files to GCS Bucket</li>
										<li>Cleans the raw data using PySpark</li>
										<li>Loads the cleaned data as delta files to GCS</li>
										<li>Creates External table in the Datasets in BigQuery by pulling data from GCS</li>
										<li>Transforms Data from BigQuery using dbt-core and creates the following in the dev/prod Dataset (along with Tests and Documentation)</li>
										<ul>
											<li>The views "stg_esports_tournaments" and "stg_esports_games_awarding_prize_money"</li>
											<li>Fact tables "fact_esports_teams_tournaments" and "fact_esports_individuals_tournaments"</li>
										</ul>
									</ul>

								<h3>OVERVIEW</h3>
								<p>Fundamental analysis involves a thorough examination of a business's fundamental financial aspects to determine its financial condition and the intrinsic value of its stock. This analysis includes assessing the business model, financial statements, profit margin, and other key indicators. Unlike relying solely on the stock price, fundamental analysts believe that additional information from economic, industry, and company analysis is necessary to accurately evaluate a stock. By comparing the fair value of a stock to its current market price, analysts expect the market price to eventually align with the fair value. They take advantage of perceived price discrepancies to profit from stock price movements. If a stock's market price is higher than its fair value, it is considered overvalued and a sell recommendation may be made. Conversely, if the market price is lower than the fair value, the stock is seen as undervalued, indicating a potential increase in price and a favorable buying opportunity.</p>
								<p>This analysis was made using the following tools: Python, SQL and Power BI. To pull the data from the web, I used the Python library called <a href="https://pypi.org/project/yfinance/" target="_blank">yfinance</a>. The data was stored in a SQL database (MySQL) and then imported into Power BI.</p>
								<h3>Dashboard</h3>
								<iframe class="analysis_iframe" title="stock_comparison_analysis" src="https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiNDljZTdlMWYtYjA4My00NTFkLTk4YTEtOGM0Mjk5MDViZGYxIiwidCI6ImIwMTMyNzIyLWM4Y2EtNGRjNy1hOGJmLWY0ZTJhZTJhOTViMSJ9" frameborder="0" allowFullScreen="true"></iframe>	
								<h3>Top 5 Fundamental Indicators</h3>
								<h4>1 Price-to-Earnings Ratio (P/E Ratio)</h4>
								<p>The P/E ratio compares a company's stock price to its earnings per share (EPS). It helps determine if a stock is overvalued or undervalued relative to its earnings. A lower P/E ratio may indicate an undervalued stock, while a higher P/E ratio may suggest an overvalued stock.</p>
								<h4>2 Price-to-Book Ratio (P/B Ratio)</h4>
								<p>The P/B ratio compares a company's stock price to its book value per share. The book value represents the company's net assets minus its liabilities. A lower P/B ratio may indicate an undervalued stock, while a higher P/B ratio may suggest an overvalued stock.</p>
								<h4>3 Dividend Yield</h4>
								<p>The dividend yield represents the annual dividend payment per share divided by the stock price. It indicates the return on investment through dividends. A higher dividend yield may be favorable for income-seeking investors.</p>
								<h4>4 Return on Equity (ROE)</h4>
								<p>ROE measures a company's profitability by comparing its net income to its shareholders' equity. It shows how efficiently a company is utilizing its shareholders' investments. A higher ROE may indicate a more profitable and efficient company.</p>
								<h4>5 Debt-to-Equity Ratio</h4>
								<p>The debt-to-equity ratio compares a company's total debt to its shareholders' equity. It helps assess the company's financial leverage and risk. A lower debt-to-equity ratio may suggest a more financially stable company, while a higher ratio may indicate higher financial risk.</p>
								<h3>Conclusion</h3>
								<p>Value investing is not reliant on a single stock metric to determine if a stock is considered a value investment. The core principle of value investing is centered around acquiring shares of high-quality companies at favorable prices and holding onto them for the long term. To achieve this, many value investors employ a combination of multiple ratios to gain a comprehensive understanding of a company's financial, earnings, and stock valuation. By considering various factors, they aim to form a more holistic assessment of a stock's value.</p>

								<h3>1 INTRODUCTION</h3>
								<p>I have always been passionate about video games and then esports. Then, I came across this dataset and I thought it would be interesting to explore the trends in the industry. I hope you enjoy this notebook as much as I enjoyed creating it.</p> 
								<p> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esports" target="_blank">Esports</a> (also known as electronic sports, e-sports, or eSports) is a form of competition using video games. Most commonly, esports takes the form of organized, multiplayer video game competitions, particularly between professional players, individually or as teams. Esports often takes the form of organized, multiplayer video game competitions, particularly between professional players, individually or as teams. Although organized competitions have long been a part of video game culture, these were largely between amateurs until the late 2000s when participation by professional gamers of all ages and amateur competitors from around the world began to take place on a more regular basis. Esports is also a multi-million dollar industry with several professional players and teams earning six-figure salaries from sponsors and prize money.</p>
								<p>This notebook will explore the trends in the industry from 1998 to 2023. The data used in this notebook is from <a href="https://www.esportsearnings.com/" target="_blank">Esports Earnings</a>. The data is available in csv format and can be downloaded from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rankirsh/esports-earnings" target="_blank">Kaggle</a>. The data is updated monthly and the latest data is from 2023-02-01.</p>
								<p>This analysis was inspired by this <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/code/rankirsh/esports-earnings-analysis/report" target="_blank">notebook</a>.</p>
								<h3>2 EXPLORATORY ANALYSIS</h3>
								<p>In this section, the data will be explored to find trends in the Esports industry</p>
								<H4>2.1 Biggest Games (Earnings)</H4>
								<p>Exploring the top 10 games with the highest earnings.</p>
								<iframe class="analysis_iframe_esports" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="//plotly.com/~DevPitta/3.embed?autosize=true&link=false"></iframe>
								<p>There are no surprise that in the top 10 games, the most popular games as Dota 2, Fortnite, CS:GO and League of Legends are present.</p>
								<p>To go deeper into the analysis, let's see the prize evolution of the top 5 games with the highest earnings.</p>
								<iframe class="analysis_iframe_esports" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="//plotly.com/~DevPitta/5.embed?autosize=true&link=false"></iframe>
								<p>It is possible to see that the games distribution of prize is not uniform. Dota 2 and LOL, for example, distribute the prizes in a cyclical manner, with a peak in prize money every year. CS:GO, on the other hand, is more stable, with a more linear distribution. For Fortnite and Arena of Valor, the distribution of prizes is irregular.</p>
								<iframe class="analysis_iframe_esports" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="//plotly.com/~DevPitta/7.embed?autosize=true&link=false"></iframe>
								<p>The earnings are concentrated in few games. The top 4 games (Dota 2, Fortnite, CS:GO and League of Legends) represent almost 50% of the total earnings and about 70% of the total earnings are concentrated in the top 10 games. It is quite surprising that about a fifth of the total earnings are solely from Dota 2.</p>
								<h4>2.2 Biggest Games (Tournaments)</h4>
								<p>Exploring the top 10 games with the highest tournaments.</p>
								<iframe class="analysis_iframe_esports" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="//plotly.com/~DevPitta/9.embed?autosize=true&link=false"></iframe>
								<p>There is not a surprise that Dota 2, Fortnite, CS:GO and League of Legends are in both the two top 10 lists. Something that is interesting is that the top 10 games with the highest earnings are not the same as the top 10 games with the highest number of tournaments. This is because some games have a lot of tournaments but the prize money is not that high. For example, the game 'Rocket League' has 2.8 thousand tournaments but the prize money is only $27 million. On the other hand, the game 'Dota 2' has 1.7 thousand tournaments but the prize money is $311 million.</p>
								<iframe class="analysis_iframe_esports" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="//plotly.com/~DevPitta/11.embed?autosize=true&link=false"></iframe>
								<p>The tournament distribution between the top 4 games is similar. However, it is interesting to observe that 'Super Smash Bros. Melee' tournaments started in 2003 and only around 2014 the amount of tournaments started to increase, but the tournaments decreased around 2018 probably due to the release of 'Super Smash Bros. Ultimate' in the same year.</p>
								<iframe class="analysis_iframe_esports" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="//plotly.com/~DevPitta/13.embed?autosize=true&link=false"></iframe>
								<p>The tournaments are less concentrated than the earnings, which reflects the fact that there are more games with a lot of tournaments but with a low prize money.</p>
								<h4>3.3 Earnings and Tournaments Over Time</h4>
								<p>In this section, we will explore the evolution of the earnings and tournaments over time.</p>
								<iframe class="analysis_iframe_esports" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="//plotly.com/~DevPitta/15.embed?autosize=true&link=false"></iframe>
								<p>It is possible to see that the number of earnings increased over time. The Esports industry jumped from earnings in 2011 and 2012 and has achieved a total of $252 million in 2019.</p>
								<p>It is interesting to observe that in 2009 due to the economic crisis and em 2020 due to the pandemic, the number of earnings decreased. Indeed the pandemic has strongly affected the esports scenario, but in 2021 and 2022 the number of earnings increased again. This demonstrates that the esports industry is resilient and is able to overcome adversities.</p>
								<iframe class="analysis_iframe_esports" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="//plotly.com/~DevPitta/17.embed?autosize=true&link=false"></iframe>
								<p>The tournaments also increased over time. The number of tournaments started strongly increasing in 2011 and has stabilized from 2015 onwards with a mean of 5 thousand tournaments.</p>
								<h4>3.4 Earnings and Tournaments by Month</h4>
								<iframe class="analysis_iframe_esports" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="//plotly.com/~DevPitta/19.embed?autosize=true&link=false"></iframe>
								<p>There is a clear pattern in the earnings by month. The earnings are concentrated in the months of August and October. This is probably due to the fact that the most important tournaments are held in these months.</p>
								<iframe class="analysis_iframe_esports" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="//plotly.com/~DevPitta/21.embed?autosize=true&link=false"></iframe>
								<p>Regarding the tournaments, the beginning of the year is the less active period, with the number of tournaments increasing from March and April.</p>
								<h4>3.5 Games that distribute prizes for the most players</h4>
								<iframe class="analysis_iframe_esports" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="//plotly.com/~DevPitta/23.embed?autosize=true&link=false"></iframe>
								<p>There is interesting to observe that the majority of the games are played in teams of 5 players (LOL, Dota 2, CS:GO) or are part of the Battle Royal genre (Fortnite, PUBG), which is a genre that is played in 100 players for each match.</p>
								<h4>3.6 Earnings by genre</h4>
								<iframe class="analysis_iframe_esports" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="//plotly.com/~DevPitta/25.embed?autosize=true&link=false"></iframe>
								<iframe class="analysis_iframe_esports" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="//plotly.com/~DevPitta/27.embed?autosize=true&link=false"></iframe>
								<p>The genre with the highest earnings as expected is the MOBA, followed by the FPS and Battle Royal. This is probably due to the fact that the this genres were projected to the esports scenario and have a lot of tournaments and prize money.</p>
								<iframe class="analysis_iframe_esports" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="//plotly.com/~DevPitta/29.embed?autosize=true&link=false"></iframe>
								<p>Regarding the number of games in each genre, is not a surprise that Fighting, FPS and Sports are the genres with the highest number of games, once these genres are more franchise and are released more often.</p>
								<iframe class="analysis_iframe_esports" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="//plotly.com/~DevPitta/31.embed?autosize=true&link=false"></iframe>
								<p>There is interesting to observe that the top 2 games with the highest earnings are in the MOBA and Battle Royal genres, which appears mostly after 2015. This is probably due to the fact that these genres were designed to the esports scenario.</p>
								<h4>3.7 Game release date</h4>
								<iframe class="analysis_iframe_esports" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="//plotly.com/~DevPitta/33.embed?autosize=true&link=false"></iframe>
								<p>It is possible to observe that the Realeases had two falls, the first in the economic crisis of 2007-2008 and the other in the pandemic period.</p>
								<iframe class="analysis_iframe_esports" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="//plotly.com/~DevPitta/35.embed?autosize=true&link=false"></iframe>
								<p>It is possible to seem that is no correlation between the release date and the success of the game. The games with the highest earnings were released in different years.</p>
								<h3>4 Conclusions</h4>
								<p>The insights of this analysis are:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>The prizes are concentrated between few games, but the tournaments are more distributed.</li>
									<li>Dota 2 is the game with the highest earnings and Starcraft II is the game with the highest number of tournaments.</li>
									<li>The number of tournaments and earnings increased over time.</li>
									<li>The earnings are concentrated in the months of August and October.</li>
									<li>Tournaments are lower in january and february, and increase from March and April continuing steadily until the end of the year.</li>
									<li>The Esports industry is mainly dominated by the MOBA and Battle Royal genres.</li>
									<li>There is not a correlation between the release date and the success of the game.</li>
									<li>The Economic crisis of 2007-2008 and the pandemic of 2020 affected the number of earnings and tournaments, but the industry is resilient and is able to overcome adversities.</li>
									<li>Finally, the Esports industry is growing and is expected to continue growing in the future, with a lot of opportunities for the future. Then, it will be interesting to see how the industry will evolve in the future.</li>

								<h3>OVERVIEW</h3>
								<p>After the Covid-19 pandemic, I became curious about the evolution of the pandemic and how it was affecting the world. Then, I decided to analyze the evolution of the pandemic in the world.</p>
								<p>Coronaviruses (CoV) are a broad family of viruses that can cause a variety of conditions, from the common cold to more serious illnesses such as Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) and respiratory syndrome. severe acute illness (SARS-CoV).</p>
								<p>Novel coronavirus (nCoV) is a new strain of coronavirus that had previously been identified in humans. Known as 2019-nCoV or COVID-19, it was only detected after an outbreak was reported in Wuhan, China, in December 2019.</p>
								<p>The data used in this analysis is from <a href="https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/blob/master/public/data/README.md" target="_blank">Our World in Data</a>, which is a scientific online publication that focuses on large global problems such as poverty, disease, hunger, climate change, war, existential risks, and inequality.</p>

								<span class="image main"><img src="images/about.png" alt="" /></span>
								<p>My name is Arthur Pitta,</p>
								<p>I am a Data Engineer and worked as a Business Intelligence Analyst resulting in tangible improvements and significant cost savings for the organization. I have a degree in Physical Education and in my master's and doctorate I used Matlab to process data. I never imagined that while studying Physical Education I would use programming. I confess that at first I was a little scared because I'm not in the area of exact sciences or technology. However, I enjoyed programming from the first contact I had with this new area of knowledge.</p>
								<p>Before starting to learn Python, I had worked with MATLAB. Due to the "similarity" between these tools in working with data, I decided to choose Python. So, I started studying python and instead of just liking it, I fell in love with programming. I decided to continue in the web development area, but by coincidence or not, I returned to the data area.</p>
								<p>I also have a vocation for teaching, so I decided to create an Instagram and post articles on Medium to share knowledge, content, doubts, difficulties and the reality of those who are learning and working with python.</p>
